## Overview

Welcome to the World Happiness Report Machine Learning Project! This repository explores the integration of machine learning techniques to enhance the analysis and insights derived from the Gallup World Happiness Report. The project aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing global happiness using machine learning techniques.

## Project Description

The Gallup World Happiness Report ranks countries based on various factors contributing to happiness, such as income, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. This project leverages machine learning to:

- **Predict Happiness Scores:** Build models to predict happiness scores based on historical data.
- **Identify Influential Factors:** Analyze non-linear and linear relationships and factors influencing happiness levels.
- **Enable Real-time Monitoring:** Implement a system for continuous monitoring of happiness trends.

- Data sourced from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness.
